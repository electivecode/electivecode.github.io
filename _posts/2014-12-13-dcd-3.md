Like last time, select `p` tag and do `console.log("%O", $0)` to output `p` tag's DOM object.

**Question:** Does the DOM object for `p` tag have a value for the key `something`?

Let's find out by looking at the output of `console.log("%O", $0)`.

![](http://cl.ly/image/001y020j1i0L/Pasted_Image_12_13_14__7_55_PM.png)

Looks like there's no key called `something`. Let's double check by typing `$0["something"]` on console:

![](http://cl.ly/image/3K09381i2r1P/Pasted_Image_12_14_14__4_58_PM.png)

`undefined` means "there's no such key." Cool. Now, another question:

**Question:** Does the DOM object for `p` tag have a value for the key `querySelector`?

Let's examine the output of `console.log("%O", $0)` again:

![](http://cl.ly/image/3A0E0F2A1n30/Pasted_Image_12_14_14__2_40_PM.png)

However, if you try `$0["querySelector"]`, it does show something:

![](http://cl.ly/image/1g0v2t2T3F3u/Pasted_Image_12_14_14__4_58_PM.png)

Why is this happening?

<i class="twa twa-5x twa-scream"></i>

## The secret `__proto__` property

Here's the secret. On the output of `console.log("%O", $0)` again. Scroll all the way down until you find the `__proto__` property.

![](http://cl.ly/image/2T0t0i2U2P34/Pasted_Image_12_14_14__3_52_PM.png)

Click on it, and you'll see another `__proto__` property.

![](http://cl.ly/image/1f1L0j0N3B3n/Pasted_Image_12_14_14__3_54_PM.png)

Keep clicking on `__proto__` again, until you reach `Element`:

![](http://cl.ly/image/0f463X1c0T1c/Pasted_Image_12_14_14__4_09_PM.png)

Scroll down, and you should see that the `querySelector` key exists!

![](http://cl.ly/image/283a1m1Y0i3V/Pasted_Image_12_14_14__4_10_PM.png)

**So here's the secret:** a JavaScript object can access the information on whatever is inside it's `__proto__` key.

`$0`'s `__proto__` object contained another `__proto__`, which contained another `__proto__`, which contained `querySelector`. This is why `$0["querySelector"]` was *not* `undefined`.

<div class="mermaid">
  graph TD;
    A($0)-->|Can access|B($0's __proto__'s information);
    B-->|Can access|C($0's __proto__'s __proto__'s information);
    C-->|etc|D(...);
</div>

## Here's what you should know:

<div class="callout callout-info">
  <h4>
    The secret of __proto__
  </h4>
  <p>
    A JavaScript object can access the information on whatever is inside it's <code>__proto__</code> key.
  </p>
</div>

## What "jQuery Objects" are:

We now know that, to access the *DOM object* for a `p` tag, you can select it on Chrome DevTools and use `$0` on it.

Now, you should know about *jQuery objects*. To get a jQuery object for a `p` tag, you can simply do:

```
$("p")
```

So let's do that on `app.js`, and print its internal information using `console.log("%O", $0)`.

```js
$(function() {
  console.log("%O", $("p"));
});
```

This is what you see:

Click on the triangle to expand. Now, try expanding the triangle next to the key `0`:

![](http://cl.ly/image/0Q0B3k2y043x/Pasted_Image_12_14_14__4_47_PM.png)

This is the same as the DOM object for the `p` tag:

![](http://cl.ly/image/0d1G1S2H1m3H/Pasted_Image_12_14_14__4_53_PM.png)

In other words, *a tag's jQuery object contains information about the tag's DOM object*.

<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading">
    <h3 class="panel-title">P Tag's jQuery Object</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>0:</strong>
          <div class="panel panel-default">
            <div class="panel-heading">
              <h3 class="panel-title">P Tag's DOM Object</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
              ...
            </div>
          </div>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

Because this `p` tag's DOM object is stored in the key `0` of the `p` tag's jQuery object, you can get a DOM object from a jQuery object by doing:

```js
$("p")[0] // Get the DOM object for `p` tag
```

Try this using `console.log`, and you'll see that this is indeed the DOM object:

![](http://cl.ly/image/2Z3H3H2F0I3t/Pasted_Image_12_14_14__5_04_PM.png)

## What else do jQuery Objects contain?

Let's examine the output of `console.log("%O", $("p"));` again to see what else is in a jQuery object.

![](http://cl.ly/image/1q390o0L3K0D/Pasted_Image_12_14_14__5_07_PM.png)

So it looks like these are other keys/values in this jQuery object:

<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading">
    <h3 class="panel-title">P Tag's jQuery Object</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>0:</strong> P Tag's DOM object</li>
      <li><strong>context:</strong> ...</li>
      <li><strong>length:</strong> 1</li>
      <li><strong>prevObject:</strong> ...</li>
      <li><strong>selector:</strong> "p"</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

You can access the value of `length` key, for example:

![](http://cl.ly/image/1U2u0A350S2f/Pasted_Image_12_14_14__5_13_PM.png)

But this is not all. Try expanding `__proto__`, and you'll see a whole a lot of keys with `function` values:

![](http://cl.ly/image/3i0f2M2N3g21/Pasted_Image_12_14_14__5_16_PM.png)

These are the jQuery methods you should be familiar with. I'm sure you've used `.hide()` in jQuery:

![](http://cl.ly/image/3L0X00131a1B/Pasted_Image_12_14_14__5_19_PM.png)

As we've seen before, an object can access information that's contained in its `__proto__`, so you can do:

```js
$("p")["hide"]
```

to access it.

![](http://cl.ly/image/0U3K0j0G2r3U/Pasted_Image_12_14_14__5_20_PM.png)

Now, in JavaScript,

```js
object["key"]
```

is the same thing as:

```js
object.key
```

So, you can do

```js
$("p").hide
```

and get the same thing back:

![](http://cl.ly/image/3L0u2G0v162G/Pasted_Image_12_14_14__5_22_PM.png)

Finally, since this is a function, you need to use `()` at the end to *execute* the function. So do:

```js
$("p").hide()
```

Then the `p` tag gets hidden.

![](http://cl.ly/image/2C0l402W032b/Pasted_Image_12_14_14__5_23_PM.png)

To show it again, do:

```js
$("p").show()
```

## In Summary...

The jQuery object for a `p` tag contains:

- The DOM object for the `p` tag, and
- A lot of jQuery functions (via `__proto__`) - [the list can be found here](http://api.jquery.com/).

To illustrate:

<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading">
    <h3 class="panel-title">P Tag's jQuery Object</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>0:</strong> P Tag's DOM object</li>
      <li><strong>context:</strong> ...</li>
      <li><strong>length:</strong> 1</li>
      <li><strong>prevObject:</strong> ...</li>
      <li><strong>selector:</strong> "p"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>jQuery functions, via <code>__proto__</code>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>add:</strong> function...</li>
      <li><strong>addBack:</strong> function...</li>
      <li><strong>addClass:</strong> function...</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

jQuery objects *enhance* a DOM object by adding a lot of jQuery functions to it.

So, here's what you should know:

<div class="callout callout-info">
  <h4>

  <p>
    jQuery objects <em>enhance</em> a DOM object by adding a lot of jQuery functions to it.
  </p>
  <p>
    jQuery objects still contain information about the corresponding DOM object.
