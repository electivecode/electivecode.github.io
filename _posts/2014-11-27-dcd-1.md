I was inspired to write a series of JavaScript lessons after reading Meng To's post: [Designers Code Differently](https://medium.com/learning-xcode-as-a-designer/designers-code-differently-e163a354d6cc) (I acronym'ed it: **DCD**). This lesson is intended for people:

- Who have solid understanding of HTML & CSS (know when to use absolute positioning; know what "clearfix" does)
- Who have basic understanding of JavaScript (know when to use Arrays and Objects; know what `console.log` does)
- Who have basic understanding of jQuery (know when to use `on` and `each` methods; know what `$(this)` does)
- Who can use GitHub (know how to fork a repository and open a pull request)
- Who want to learn just enough JavaScript to be dangerous (aka prototype simple UIs)

If you don't have these pre-requisite skills, head over to [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com).

### Setting Up GitHub

- First, let us know your GitHub username (just tweet at [@electivecode](http://twitter.com/electivecode)). We will add you to the [electivecode](http://github.com/electivecode) organization on GitHub.
- Next, head over to http://github.com/electivecode/class and clone the repo on your computer.
- Create a branch called `<your-github-username>` from master. For example, if your GitHub username is `chibicode`, create a `chibicode` branch from master.
- Create a folder called `<your-github-username>` on the root level. For example, if your GitHub username is `chibicode`, create a `chibicode` folder.
- Next, [go to this gist](https://gist.github.com/chibicode/b5eddf974b42fc8b2fe4), download it, unarchive it into the folder you just created, and name the folder `dcd-task1`.
- Commit everything, push everything to GitHub, and open a pull request. We will not merge your pull request yet, but we will take a look at it so you set everything up correctly.

<!-- ### Setting Up Slack -->

<!-- - You can join us on [Slack](http://slack.com) at [http://electivecode-class.slack.com](http://electivecode-class.slack.com) if you have more questions. -->

## Lesson 1: Source Code Does Not Change

Let's open `index.html`. You should see a button called <mark>Say Hello</mark>. Clicking this will append `Hello ` to the `p` tag below. Here's the relevant code:

<p data-gist-id="b5eddf974b42fc8b2fe4" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-file="index.html" data-gist-line="22-26"></p>

<p data-gist-id="b5eddf974b42fc8b2fe4" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-file="app.js"></p>

Now, try clicking the button several times, and open the Chrome DevTools. You'll see that `p` tags now contain multiple `Hello `'s.

Now, view source using <kbd>⌥⌘U</kbd>. You realize that the source code *does not* contain `Hello `'s.

To summarize:

<div class="callout callout-info">
  <h4>
    HTML code in Chrome DevTools v.s. HTML code in the source
  </h4>
  <p>
    JavaScript modifies HTML code in Chrome DevTools, but not in the source.
  </p>
</div>

### HTML Source becomes a "DOM"

Roughly speaking, when a browser interprets HTML source code, the browser turns the HTML into something called **DOM** (Document Object Model).

<div class="mermaid">
  graph TD;
    A(HTML Source)-->|Browser interprets HTML|B(DOM);
</div>

When JavaScript runs, the browser's DOM is being modified, not the source code.

<div class="mermaid">
  graph TD;
    A(HTML Source)-->|Browser interprets HTML|B(DOM);
    C(JavaScript)-->|changes|B;
</div>

So, what's being displayed on Chrome DevTools is *not* the HTML source, but is the DOM.

![](http://cl.ly/image/0X0r1G1o1I41/Pasted_Image_12_11_14__3_16_PM.png)

<div class="mermaid">
  graph TD;
    A(HTML Source)-->|Browser interprets HTML|B(DOM);
    C(JavaScript)-->|changes|B;
    B-->|Displayed on|D(Chrome DevTools);
</div>

Also, current DOM is what's being displayed on the browser.

<div class="mermaid">
  graph TD;
    A(HTML Source)-->|Browser interprets HTML|B(DOM);
    C(JavaScript)-->|changes|B;
    B-->|Displayed on|D(Chrome DevTools);
    B-->|Displayed on|E(Browser);
</div>

So, here's the key thing to remember:

<div class="callout callout-info">
  <h4>
    JavaScript and the DOM
  </h4>
  <p>
    JavaScript modifies the DOM, not the original source. The browser displays the current state of the DOM to users.
  </p>
</div>

### So What?

What's a DOM, anyway? What's special about the DOM? What's the difference between a DOM and the original source?

We'll answer these questions on the next lesson. But for now, please push your code:

<div class="callout callout-warning">
  <h4>
    Push Your Code and Open a Pull Request
  </h4>
  <p>
    I'll make sure that you're set up correctly.
  </p>
</div>
