## Answer to the last question on the previous lesson

In the previous lesson, we asked you to model sketch the following UI:

![](http://cl.ly/image/382x0l040l0P/Pasted_Image_12_23_14__11_54_AM.png)

And here's the answer:

```js
var titleSection = "Chibinews";
var leftDropdown = {
  "name": "Categories",
  "content": ["Politics", "Finance", "Technology"]
};
var leftSection = ["Newsletters", "Archive", leftDropdown];
var rightDropdown = {
  "name": "Languages",
  "content": ["Politics", "Español", "中文"]
};
var rightSection = ["About", rightDropdown];

var ui = {
  "title": titleSection,
  "left": leftSection,
  "right": rightSection
};
```

Again, it's easier if we introduce intermediate variables. In this case, `titleSection`, `leftDropdown`, `leftSection`, `rightDropdown`, and `rightSection` are the intermediate variables.

## Querying Data

Let's play with the final `ui` variable and query some data.

**Question:** Write JS code that prints the name of the right dropdown.

**Answer:** Right dropdown is the second element of the right section, so:

```js
console.log(ui["right"][1]["name"]);
```

The above should print `Languages`.

**Try this if you can:** Write JS code that prints the first element of the left dropdown. You don't need to push this code - just try it on your computer.

## Today's Model Sketch

We're going to model sketch more complicated UI today. We'll try GitHub Issues UI:

![](http://cl.ly/image/2I3i020f2j3n/Pasted_Image_12_24_14__4_50_AM.png)

Please view the UI from here so you know what you're sketching:

<a href="https://github.com/electivecode/model-sketch-practice/issues?q=" class="btn btn-primary">View the UI &rarr;</a>

Your task is:

1. Model sketch this UI on `app.js`.
2. Write code that prints out the labels of open issues, using `for` loop.

<p data-gist-id="02c3ea6acc4e04dd2747" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-file="app.js"></p>
