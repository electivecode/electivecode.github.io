## Answer to the last question on the previous lesson

In the previous lesson, we asked you to model sketch the following UI:

![](http://cl.ly/image/382x0l040l0P/Pasted_Image_12_23_14__11_54_AM.png)

And here's the answer:

```js
var titleSection = "Chibinews";
var leftDropdown = {
  "name": "Categories",
  "content": ["Politics", "Finance", "Technology"]
};
var leftSection = ["Newsletters", "Archive", leftDropdown];
var rightDropdown = {
  "name": "Languages",
  "content": ["Politics", "Español", "中文"]
};
var rightSection = ["About", rightDropdown];

var ui = {
  "title": titleSection,
  "left": leftSection,
  "right": rightSection
};
```

Again, it's easier if we introduce intermediate variables. In this case, `titleSection`, `leftDropdown`, `leftSection`, `rightDropdown`, and `rightSection` are the intermediate variables.

## Querying Data

Let's play with the final `ui` variable and query some data.

**Question:** Write JS code that prints the name of the right dropdown.

**Answer:** Right dropdown is the second element of the right section, so:

```js
console.log(ui["right"][1]["name"]);
```

The above should print `Languages`.

**Try this if you can:** Write JS code that prints the first element of the left dropdown. You don't need to push this code - just try it on your computer.

## Today's Model Sketch

We're going to model sketch more complicated UI today. We'll try GitHub Issues UI:

![](http://cl.ly/image/3N282G1u363v/Pasted_Image_12_24_14__7_29_AM.png)

Please view the UI from here so you know what you're sketching:

{% capture view_ui %}
<a href="https://github.com/electivecode/model-sketch-practice/issues?q=" class="btn btn-primary">View the UI &rarr;</a>
{% endcapture %}{{ view_ui }}

Your task is:

{% capture task %}
<ol>
<li>Model sketch this UI on <code>app.js</code>.</li>
<li>Write code that prints out the labels of open issues, using <code>for</code> loop.</li>
</ol>
<p data-gist-id="02c3ea6acc4e04dd2747" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-file="app.js"></p>
{% endcapture %}{{ task }}

## Requirements

### 1. Only sketch the "data"

When we're doing model sketch, the only thing we need to sketch is the **data** in a page. For GitHub Issues, the red area contains actual data. The rest is just filters, checkboxes, etc. that *work on top of the data*. They're not part of the data, so we are not going to model sketch them.

### 2. Each issue has status, which can be "open" or "closed"

![](http://cl.ly/image/0d3C1D2F1a3C/Pasted_Image_12_24_14__7_09_AM.png)

### 3. Each issue has a title and multiple labels

![](http://cl.ly/image/0v1R0v470b3f/Pasted_Image_12_24_14__7_32_AM.png)

### 4. Each issue has a number. An issue may have a milestone. You can ignore the time.

![](http://cl.ly/image/081W1s0g1F1Z/Pasted_Image_12_24_14__7_35_AM.png)

You **do not** need to sketch the timestamp.

### 5. Each issue has a comment count and may have an assignee.

## That's it!

Good luck! Again, your task is:

{{ task }}

{{ view_ui }}
