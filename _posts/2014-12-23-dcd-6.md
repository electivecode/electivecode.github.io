## Answers to the last question on the previous lesson

Before we start, let's go over the answer to the last question on the previous lesson. We needed to model sketch this:

{% capture table5 %}
<table>
  <tr>
    <th class="info"></th>
    <th class="info">
      Apple
    </th>
    <th class="info">
      Microsoft
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="info">
      Desktop OS
    </th>
    <td>
      Mac OS
    </td>
    <td>
      Windows
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="info">
      Tablet Name
    </th>
    <td>
      iPad
    </td>
    <td>
      Surface
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
{% endcapture %}
{{ table5 }}

Let's try to describe the above UI in plain English:

- **UI**: For `Apple`, its `Desktop OS` is `Mac OS` and its `Tablet Name` is `iPad`. For `Microsoft`, its `Desktop OS` is `Windows` and its `Tablet Name` is `Surface`.

This translates to the following JavaScript:

```js
var ui = {
  "Apple": {
    "Desktop OS": "Mac OS",
    "Tablet Name": "iPad"
  },
  "Microsoft": {
    "Desktop OS": "Windows",
    "Tablet Name": "Surface"
  }
}
```

Explanation:

- **JavaScript**: `ui` is a JavaScript object with two keys, `Apple` and `Microsoft`. For the `Apple` key, the value is another JavaScript object. This object contains two keys: `Desktop OS` and `Tablet Name` with values `Mac OS` and `iPad` respectively. For the `Microsoft` key of `ui`, the value is another JavaScript object. This object contains two keys: `Desktop OS` and `Tablet Name` with values `Windows` and `Surface` respectively.

This is not part of the answer, but you can query information from this `ui` variable:

```js
// Prints Apple's Desktop OS:
console.log(ui["Apple"]["Desktop OS"]);
```

The above should print `Mac OS`.

### Alternative Answer

{{ table5 }}

There's another correct answer. If you interpreted the UI as follows:

- **UI**: There are two `Desktop OS`s. One is `Apple`'s, which is `Mac OS` and another is `Microsoft`'s, which is `Windows`. Also, there are two `Tablet Name`s. One is `Apple`'s, which is `iPad` and another is `Microsoft`'s, which is `Surface`.

Then it'd translate to the following JS code:

```js
var ui = {
  "Desktop OS": {
    "Apple": "Mac OS",
    "Microsoft": "Windows"
  },
  "Tablet Name": {
    "Apple": "iPad",
    "Microsoft": "Surface"
  }
}
```

The above is correct too.
