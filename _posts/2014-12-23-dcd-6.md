## Answers to the last question on the previous lesson

Before we start, let's go over the answer to the last question on the previous lesson. We needed to model sketch this:

{% capture table5 %}
<table>
  <tr>
    <th class="info"></th>
    <th class="info">
      Apple
    </th>
    <th class="info">
      Microsoft
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="info">
      Desktop OS
    </th>
    <td>
      Mac OS
    </td>
    <td>
      Windows
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="info">
      Tablet Name
    </th>
    <td>
      iPad
    </td>
    <td>
      Surface
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
{% endcapture %}
{{ table5 }}

Let's try to describe the above UI in plain English:

- **UI**: For `Apple`, its `Desktop OS` is `Mac OS` and its `Tablet Name` is `iPad`. For `Microsoft`, its `Desktop OS` is `Windows` and its `Tablet Name` is `Surface`.

This translates to the following JavaScript:

```js
var ui = {
  "Apple": {
    "Desktop OS": "Mac OS",
    "Tablet Name": "iPad"
  },
  "Microsoft": {
    "Desktop OS": "Windows",
    "Tablet Name": "Surface"
  }
};
```

Explanation:

- **JavaScript**: `ui` is a JavaScript object with two keys, `Apple` and `Microsoft`. For the `Apple` key, the value is another JavaScript object. This object contains two keys: `Desktop OS` and `Tablet Name` with values `Mac OS` and `iPad` respectively. For the `Microsoft` key of `ui`, the value is another JavaScript object. This object contains two keys: `Desktop OS` and `Tablet Name` with values `Windows` and `Surface` respectively.

This is not part of the answer, but you can query information from this `ui` variable:

```js
// Prints Apple's Desktop OS:
console.log(ui["Apple"]["Desktop OS"]);
```

The above should print `Mac OS`.

## Alternative Answer

{{ table5 }}

There's another correct answer. If you interpreted the UI as follows:

- **UI**: There are two `Desktop OS`s. One is `Apple`'s, which is `Mac OS` and another is `Microsoft`'s, which is `Windows`. Also, there are two `Tablet Name`s. One is `Apple`'s, which is `iPad` and another is `Microsoft`'s, which is `Surface`.

Then it'd translate to the following JS code:

```js
var ui = {
  "Desktop OS": {
    "Apple": "Mac OS",
    "Microsoft": "Windows"
  },
  "Tablet Name": {
    "Apple": "iPad",
    "Microsoft": "Surface"
  }
};
```

The above is correct too.

## Answer Using Variables

Let's go back to our original answer:

```js
var ui = {
  "Apple": {
    "Desktop OS": "Mac OS",
    "Tablet Name": "iPad"
  },
  "Microsoft": {
    "Desktop OS": "Windows",
    "Tablet Name": "Surface"
  }
};
```

There's a way to rewrite the above `ui` variable like this:

```js
var apple = {
  "Desktop OS": "Mac OS",
  "Tablet Name": "iPad"
};

var microsoft = {
  "Desktop OS": "Windows",
  "Tablet Name": "Surface"
}

var ui = {
  "Apple": apple,
  "Microsoft": microsoft
};
```

This technique is called **introducing intermediate variables**.

This is basically the same thing. Now, is this *easier to understand* (better code) than before? This is personal preference, but for me, before and after are both easy to understand.

So what's the point? Well, when we start sketching *complicated* UI, it's easier to read if we introduce intermediate variables.

## Today's Model Sketch

Today, we'll sketch Bootstrap's navbar. The folder you just downloaded should contain just enough HTML to show this navbar.

<a href="http://bl.ocks.org/chibicode/596f0033c5f7b8386dbb" class="btn btn-primary">View Navbar &rarr;</a>

![](http://cl.ly/image/3F3b390Q0Y3J/Pasted_Image_12_23_14__10_36_AM.png)

We're going to model sketch this using JavaScript.

## How to get started?

As always, we're going to start by describing the UI using plain English:

First, navbar UI has three components:

- **Title section**. In this case, it's the text called `Chibinews`.
- **Left section**. In this case, it's the text called `Newsletters` and `Archive`, as well as the dropdown menu `Categories`.
- **Right section**. In this case, it's the text called `About`, as well as the dropdown menu `Languages`.

![](http://cl.ly/image/0Z1m421f1z1z/Pasted_Image_12_23_14__10_36_AM.png)

So, let's write this in JavaScript. First, we'll create variables for each of the above three sections as placeholders. Then, we assign `title`, `left`, and `right` keys to each variable.

```js
// Placeholders - we'll do this later:
var titleSection;
var leftSection;
var rightSection;

var ui = {
  "title": titleSection,
  "left": leftSection,
  "right": rightSection
};
```

As you can see, we're using **introducing intermediate variables** technique from the previous section.

## Title Section

Now, let's sketch the title section. This one's easy.

![](http://cl.ly/image/1n2k3R1j2b0z/Pasted_Image_12_23_14__11_25_AM.png)

There's just the text `Chibinews` here. So let's assign `"Chibinews"` to `titleSection`:

```js
var titleSection = "Chibinews";
...

var ui = {
  "title": titleSection,
  "left": leftSection,
  "right": rightSection
};
```

## Left Section

Now, let's work on the left section:

![](http://cl.ly/image/252A0R3y140e/Pasted_Image_12_23_14__11_29_AM.png)

If we describe this in plain English from left to right:

1. A link called `Newsletters`
2. A link called `Archive`
3. A dropdown called `Categories`

Let's keep it simple and use Strings to represent links. Each link may have a URL, but let's ignore that for this lesson.

```js
...
var leftSection = ["Newsletters", "Archive", ...];
...

var ui = {
  ...
};
```

Now, as for the dropdown, let's create another variable to represent this dropdown. We'll work on this next.

```js
...
var leftDropdown;
var leftSection = ["Newsletters", "Archive", leftDropdown];
...

var ui = {
  ...
};
```

## Left Dropdown

![](http://cl.ly/image/2B331n153u0s/Pasted_Image_12_23_14__11_44_AM.png)

Let's describe this using plain English.

- The **name** of the dropdown is `Categories`.
- The **content** of the dropdown consists of three links: `Politics`, `Finance`, and `Technology`.

You can use "title" instead of "name". You can even use "list" instead of "content". You can use anything as long as it's easy to understand.

The above English translates to the following JavaScript:

```js
...
var leftDropdown = {
  "name": "Categories",
  "content": ["Politics", "Finance", "Technology"]
};
...
```

So, we now have this:

```js
var titleSection = "Chibinews";
var leftDropdown = {
  "name": "Categories",
  "content": ["Politics", "Finance", "Technology"]
};
var leftSection = ["Newsletters", "Archive", leftDropdown];
var rightSection;

var ui = {
  "title": titleSection,
  "left": leftSection,
  "right": rightSection
};
```

## Question for You: Implement rightSection

We're now left with `rightSection`. Implement this, commit and submit a pull request.

Good luck! Here are the takeaways:
