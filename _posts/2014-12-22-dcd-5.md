## HTML Sketch and Model Sketch

[When I taught my girlfriend to code in 2013](https://medium.com/@chibicode/teaching-someone-to-code-is-partly-a-hardware-problem-fe6a2067d770), I taught her **HTML Sketch**, which can be described as follows:

- Given some UI,
- Write the cleanest HTML & CSS code that mimics this UI.

The first page she HTML-sketched on was some Japanese site. Here, she's trying to mimic the actual page (right) using HTML and CSS (left).

After doing this exercise for a variety of UIs on the web, her HTML/CSS skill improved dramatically. I believe this is one of the best ways to improve your HTML/CSS skill.

**Model Sketch** is similar to this, but it's for JavaScript.

- Given some UI,
- *Write JavaScript code* that describes this UI.

Huh?

You might have the following questions:

1. What does "JavaScript code that describes this UI" even mean?
2. Why is it called "Model Sketch"?

We won't get to #2, but we will definitely answer #1 on the next section. Let's dive in.

## Example Model Sketch

Let's say that we have this table:

{% capture table %}
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>c</td>
  </tr>
</table>
{% endcapture %}
{{ table }}

If we were to sketch this using HTML, this would be correct:

```html
{{ table }}
```

Now, how can we sketch this table using JavaScript?

{{ table }}

Here's the hint. In *Model Sketch*, you assign some JavaScript expression to a JavaScript variable. You can use any variable name.

```js
var ui = ...
```

Now, here's the answer:

```js
var ui = ["A", "B", "C"];
```

Why is this correct? Because:

- **UI**: The table has three elements. The first element is `A`. The second element is `B`. The third element is `C`.
- **JavaScript**: `ui` is a JavaScript variable, which is an array of three elements. The first element is `"A"`. The second element is `"B"`. The third element is `"C"`.

Therefore, the above JS code *describes* the UI. This is **Model Sketch**. Simple, right?
