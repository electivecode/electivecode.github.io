## HTML Sketch and Model Sketch

[When I taught my girlfriend to code in 2013](https://medium.com/@chibicode/teaching-someone-to-code-is-partly-a-hardware-problem-fe6a2067d770), I taught her **HTML Sketch**, which can be described as follows:

- Given some UI,
- Write the cleanest HTML & CSS code that mimics this UI.

The first page she HTML-sketched on was some Japanese site. Here, she's trying to mimic the actual page (right) using HTML and CSS (left).

After doing this exercise for a variety of UIs on the web, her HTML/CSS skill improved dramatically. I believe this is one of the best ways to improve your HTML/CSS skill.

**Model Sketch** is similar to this, but it's for JavaScript.

- Given some UI,
- *Write JavaScript code* that describes this UI.

Huh?

<i class="twa twa-5x twa-confused"></i>

You might have the following questions:

1. What does "JavaScript code that describes this UI" even mean?
2. Why is it called "Model Sketch"?

We won't get to #2, but we will definitely answer #1 on the next section. Let's dive in.

## Example Model Sketch

Let's say that we have this table:

{% capture table %}
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>c</td>
  </tr>
</table>
{% endcapture %}
{{ table }}

If we were to sketch this using HTML, this would be correct:

```html
{{ table }}
```

Now, how can we sketch this table using JavaScript?

{{ table }}

Here's the hint. In *Model Sketch*, you assign some JavaScript expression to a JavaScript variable. You can use any variable name.

```js
var ui = ...
```

Now, here's the answer:

```js
var ui = ["A", "B", "C"];
```

Why is this correct? Because:

- **UI**: The table has three elements. The first element is `A`. The second element is `B`. The third element is `C`.
- **JavaScript**: `ui` is a JavaScript variable, which is an array of three elements. The first element is `"A"`. The second element is `"B"`. The third element is `"C"`.

Therefore, the above JS code *describes* the UI. This is **Model Sketch**. Simple, right?

## Model Sketch, Sample Question 1

How about this UI?

{% capture table2 %}
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      A
    </td>
    <td>
      B
    </td>
    <td>
      C
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      D
    </td>
    <td>
      E
    </td>
    <td>
      F
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
{% endcapture %}
{{ table2 }}

In Model Sketch, there's more than one correct answer. For example, this one works:

```js
var x = [ ["A", "B", "C"], ["D", "E", "F"] ];
```

Explanation:

- **UI**: The table has two rows, each with three elements. On the first row, the first element is `A`. The second element is `B`. The third element is `C`. On the second row, the first element is `D`. The second element is `E`. The third element is `F`.
- **JavaScript**: `ui` is a JavaScript variable, which is an array of two arrays, each with three elements. For the first array, the first element is `"A"`. The second element is `"B"`. The third element is `"C"`. For the second array, the first element is `"D"`. The second element is `"E"`. The third element is `"F"`.

(If you haven't seen "Arrays of Arrays" like above, I recommend Array lessons on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/working-with-indexed-associate-and-multi-dimensional-arrays/0/1) or [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-2).)

On the other hand, this is correct too:

```js
var x = [ ["A", "D"], ["B", "E"], ["C", "F"] ];
```

Explanation:

- **UI**: The table has three columns, each with two elements. On the first column, the first element is `A`. The second element is `D`. On the second column, the first element is `B`. The second element is `E`. On the third column, the first element is `C`. The second element is `F`.
- **JavaScript**: `ui` is a JavaScript variable, which is an array of three arrays, each with two elements. For the first array, the first element is `"A"`. The second element is `"D"`. For the second array, the first element is `"B"`. The second element is `"E"`. For the second array, the first element is `"C"`. The second element is `"F"`.

### Here's what you should remember:

## Model Sketch, Sample Question 2

Now, how do you model sketch this UI?

{% capture table3 %}
<table>
  <tr class="info">
    <th>
      First Name
    </th>
    <th>
      Last Name
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Bill
    </td>
    <td>
      Gates
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Steve
    </td>
    <td>
      Jobs
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
{% endcapture %}
{{ table3 }}

This one's a bit tricky. Let's try to describe the UI in plain English first.

- **UI**: The table has two *items*, each with three *properties*. For the first item, its `First Name` is `Bill` and its `Last Name` is `Gates`. For the second item , its `First Name` is `Steve` and its `Last Name` is `Jobs`.

How do you describe "its `First Name` is `Bill` and its `Last Name` is `Gates`" in JavaScript?

Answer: *use objects*.

```js
{
  "First Name": "Bill",
  "Last Name": "Gates"
}
```

Same for "its `First Name` is `Steve` and its `Last Name` is `Jobs`":

```js
{
  "First Name": "Steve",
  "Last Name": "Jobs"
}
```

You can now combine these using an array:

```js
var ui = [
  {
    "First Name": "Bill",
    "Last Name": "Gates"
  },
  {
    "First Name": "Steve",
    "Last Name": "Jobs"
  }
];
```

Note: The above code is the same thing as the code below. But the above code is easier to read.

```js
var ui = [{ "First Name": "Bill", "Last Name": "Gates" }, { "First Name": "Steve", "Last Name": "Jobs" }];
```

## Querying Data

Model sketch is similar to UI also because you can query data. For example, let me ask you the following question:

**Question:** With the following data, what's the `Last Name` of the *first* element in the table?

{% capture table4 %}
<table>
  <tr class="info">
    <th>
      First Name
    </th>
    <th>
      Last Name
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Bill
    </td>
    <td class="success">
      Gates
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Steve
    </td>
    <td>
      Jobs
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
{% endcapture %}
{{ table4 }}

**Answer:** It's `Gates`.

You can do the same thing with Model Sketch:


```js
var ui = [
  {
    "First Name": "Bill",
    "Last Name": "Gates"
  },
  {
    "First Name": "Steve",
    "Last Name": "Jobs"
  }
];

// Print the last name of the first element
console.log(ui[0]["Last Name"]);
```

Try this on `app.js`, and you should see `Gates` on the console when you refresh the page.

## Question for You

To conclude today's lesson, I'd like you to model sketch the following UI:

{% capture table5 %}
<table>
  <tr>
    <th class="info"></th>
    <th class="info">
      Apple
    </th>
    <th class="info">
      Microsoft
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="info">
      Desktop OS
    </th>
    <td>
      Mac OS
    </td>
    <td>
      Windows
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th class="info">
      Tablet Name
    </th>
    <td>
      iPad
    </td>
    <td>
      Surface
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
{% endcapture %}
{{ table5 }}

Write your code in `app.js`:

```js
var ui = ...
```

Commit it, and then submit a pull request.

Here are some hints:

- There are two right answers.
- You should not need to use an array.

Good luck!
