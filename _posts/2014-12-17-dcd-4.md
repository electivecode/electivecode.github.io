## `$(function() { ... })`

In today's lesson, we'll talk about what this does:

```js
// What's the reason we code like this?
$(function() {
  code();
});
```

Why can't we skip `$(function(){})`, and just write this?

```js
// Can't we just do this?
code();
```

## Getting Started

Let's look at the code. First on `index.html`, you see that there's a `p` tag, then it loads jQuery followed by `app.js`.

<p data-gist-id="5ac7d32d2918e0f04ef9" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-file="index.html" data-gist-line="20-24"></p>

On JS, we have `$(function(){})` and inside, it shows whatever is inside `p` tag.

<p data-gist-id="5ac7d32d2918e0f04ef9" data-gist-hide-footer="true" data-gist-file="app.js"></p>

...which prints "Goodbye".

## Getting rid of `$(function() { ... })`

Now, let's get rid of `$(function() { ... })` on `app.js` and see if it still works. Let's comment out these two lines:

```js
// $(function() {
  console.log($("p").html());
// });
```

Now, check to see if this still works. Refresh the page and check console.

It still works! Then why do we need `$(function() { ... })`?

I'll have an answer for you shortly.

## Put `script` above `p`

Next, let's move `script` tags above the `p` tag.

```html
<script src="jquery-2.1.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="app.js"></script>
<p>Goodbye</p>
```

Now refresh the page and check console.

![](http://cl.ly/image/112S3646373u/Pasted_Image_12_17_14__9_00_PM.png)

It's now saying `undefined`!

Why is this happening?

## Put `$(function() { ... })` back again

Finally, uncomment `$(function() { ... })` on `app.js`:

```js
$(function() {
  console.log($("p").html());
});
```

Then refresh the page and check console.

It's working again!

## Let's make a table...

{% capture table %}<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th><code>script</code> after <code>p</code> (usual)</th>
    <th><code>script</code> before <code>p</code></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Use <code>$(function(){})</code></th>
    <td class="success">Works!</td>
    <td class="success">Works!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Don't use <code>$(function(){})</code></th>
    <td class="success">Works!</td>
    <td class="danger">Doesn't work</td>
  </tr>
</table>{% endcapture %}
{{ table }}

## Why does this happen?

Here's the secret. When the browser reads the following HTML...

```html
<p>Goodbye</p>
<script src="jquery-2.1.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

Here's what happens:

1. It reads the `p` tag and *creates a DOM object for it*.
1. It loads and executes `jquery-2.1.1.min.js`.
1. It loads and executes `app.js`.

On the other hand, when the browser reads the following HTML...

```html
<script src="jquery-2.1.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="app.js"></script>
<p>Goodbye</p>
```

Here's what happens:

1. It loads and executes `jquery-2.1.1.min.js`.
1. It loads and executes `app.js`.
1. It reads the `p` tag and *creates a DOM object for it*.

In other words, in this case, `app.js` gets executed *before* the DOM object for `p` tag exists.

### There's no DOM object!

If HTML looks like this...

```html
<script src="jquery-2.1.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="app.js"></script>
<p>Goodbye</p>
```

And `app.js` *does not* use `$(function(){})`...

```js
// $(function() {
  console.log($("p").html());
// });
```

Then `console.log($("p").html());` gets executed *before* there's a DOM object for `p` tag.

This doesn't work, because `$("p")` searches for `p`'s DOM object, which doesn't exist. This is why `console.log()` outputs `undefined` in this case.

In other words:

1. It loads and executes `jquery-2.1.1.min.js`.
1. It loads and executes `app.js`, *but there's no DOM object* for the `p` tag yet. So `$("p")` doesn't work, and `console.log` prints `undefined`.
1. It reads the `p` tag and creates a DOM object for it. *But it's too LATE!*

### What if you use `$(function(){})`

However, even when HTML is like this (DOM object for the `p` tag doesn't exist when `app.js` is executed):

```html
<script src="jquery-2.1.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="app.js"></script>
<p>Goodbye</p>
```

This works:

```js
$(function() {
  console.log($("p").html());
});
```

Why? Well, here's what `$(function(){})` means:

```js
$(function() {
  // Any code in here will be executed
  // AFTER all DOM objects on the page are created.
});
```

I'll repeat, because it's important:

{% capture callout4_1 %}
<div class="callout callout-info">
  <h4>
    What does <code>$(function(){})</code> mean?
  </h4>
  <p>
    Code inside <code>$(function(){})</code> is executed <em>after</em> all DOM objects on the page are created.
  </p>
</div>
{% endcapture %}
{{ callout4_1 }}

### What Actually Happens

In other words, for the following HTML and JS:

```html
<script src="jquery-2.1.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="app.js"></script>
<p>Goodbye</p>
```

```js
$(function() {
  console.log($("p").html());
});
```

Here's what *actually* happens:

1. It loads and executes `jquery-2.1.1.min.js`.
1. It loads and executes `app.js`, but *nothing gets executed yet.*
1. It reads the `p` tag and *creates a DOM object for it*.
1. Now that all DOM objects are created, it executes what's inside `$(function(){})` on `app.js`, which is: `console.log($("p").html());`.

### What if it's below

What about this case? `app.js` below `p`, and `$(function(){})` is commented out.

```html
<p>Goodbye</p>
<script src="jquery-2.1.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

```js
// $(function() {
  console.log($("p").html());
// });
```

This works, because:

1. It reads the `p` tag and *creates a DOM object for it*.
1. It loads and executes `jquery-2.1.1.min.js`.
1. It loads and executes `app.js`. It works because the DOM object for `p` already exists, and therefore `$("p")` is valid.

## Implications

As you can see from the table:

{{ table }}

As long as you put `script` tags after all the other tags, *you do not need to* use `$(function(){})`.

However, if you're writing a JavaScript library *for someone else*, you can't rely that he/she will put `<script>` after all the other tags. For example, if you don't use `$(function(){})` in your library and the user of your library puts `<script>` inside `<head>`, your library will not work.

That's not good.

So, it's a good practice to *always* put your code inside `$(function(){})` so that the user of your code can put `<script>` for your library anywhere.

## Conclusion

{{ callout4_1 }}

<div class="callout callout-info">
  <h4>
    Why should I always use <code>$(function(){})</code>?
  </h4>
  <p>
    By always putting your code inside <code>$(function(){});</code>, users of your code can put the <code>script</code> tag for your library anywhere.
  </p>
</div>

## What you now know

Congratulations! You now know everything about this code:

```js
$(function() {
  console.log($("p").html());
});
```

It says,

1. *After* all DOM objects on the page are created, then
1. Run `console.log($("p").html());`, which:
    1. Gets the jQuery object for the `p` tag, and
    1. Prints out HTML code inside the `p` tag.

And remember from lesson 3 that jQuery objects contain the corresponding DOM object and adds a lot of functions to it.
